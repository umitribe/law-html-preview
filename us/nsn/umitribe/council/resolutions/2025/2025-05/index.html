                <p>WHEREAS, the Council has reviewed the First Election Law of 2023, and considered amendments to reflect a General Election Law applicable to future elections in accordance with the Tribe's Constitution; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, this Resolution shall be referred to as the "Election Law of 2025."</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Council hereby approves the attached amendments to "First Election Law of 2023," renamed to the "Election Law of the Upper Mattaponi Tribe," and directs that these amendments be codified under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/umitribe/council/code/45" title="Title 45 Voting and Elections">Title 45, Voting and Elections</a>.</p>
