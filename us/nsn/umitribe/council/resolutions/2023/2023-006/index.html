                <p>WHEREAS; On July 22, 2023, the citizens of the Upper Mattaponi Tribe ("Tribe") voted to adopt a new constitution ("Constitution") to assert the Tribe's sovereign authority as a federally-recognized Indian tribe and to reorganize the Tribe's government to exercise its full authority in a fair and equitable manner; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS; The Constitution establishes an executive branch of government comprised of the Chief, Assistant Chief, and various Departments and programs; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS; The Department of Finance, the Department of Records Management, and other key Departments serve critical needs in the operation of the Tribe's government, and employing well-qualified individuals as Directors of these Departments will help ensure the efficient and professional delivery of services; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS; In order to retain well-qualified individuals to serve in these critical positions, the Tribe must offer enforceable employment contracts in order to attract experienced professionals to work for the Tribe; and,</p>
