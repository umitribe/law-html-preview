                <p>In consideration for Rockefeller Financial LLC ("Rockefeller Financial") opening and continuing brokerage accounts, and National Financial Services LLC ("NFS") carrying such accounts, for the Upper Mattaponi Tribe ("You" or the "Tribe"), a federally recognized Tribe with sovereign immunity from unconsented suit, You, Rockefeller Financial, and NFS (collectively the "Parties" and individually a "Party") agree as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum1.">1.</span> <span class="level-heading">Existence and Standing.</span> The Tribe is federally recognized as an Indian tribe and appears on the latest list of <em>Indian Tribal Entities Within the Contiguous 48 States Recognized by and Eligible To Receive Services From the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs</em>, 89 Fed. Reg. 944.  The tribal Articles of Association were duly and validly adopted, is the only governing document of the Tribe, and is the valid and governing law of the Tribe.  The Tribe certifies it has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver the Addendum to which it is a party, and to perform obligations under said document.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum2.">2.</span> <span class="level-heading">Authorization and Validity.</span> The Tribal Council is the governing body of the Tribe.  The execution, delivery, and performance by the Tribe under this Addendum has been duly authorized by all necessary tribal actions by the Tribal Council.  This Addendum to which the Tribe is a party when executed will constitute the legal, valid, and binding obligations of the Tribe, enforceable against the Tribe in accordance with the terms.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum3.">3.</span> <span class="level-heading">No Conflict; Government Consent.</span> The execution, delivery and performance by the Tribe of the Addendum will not (a) violate any provision of any law, statute, rule or regulation (including any Gaming Law) or any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award of any court, governmental agency or arbitrator presently in effect having applicability to the Tribe, (b) violate or contravene any provision of the Articles of Association or other tribal governing documents, or (c) result in a breach of or constitute a default under any indenture, loan or credit agreement or any other agreement, lease or instrument to which the Tribe is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be bound or result in the creation of any Lien thereunder.  No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, including the Secretary of the Department of the Interior or the Chairman of the National Indian Gaming Commission, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by the Tribe, is required to be obtained by the Tribe in connection with the execution and delivery of the Addendum.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum4.">4.</span> <span class="level-heading">Exhaustion of Tribal Remedies.</span> As authorized by resolution of the Tribal Council, dated _____ <em>and attached hereto</em>, the Tribe hereby agrees that any action to enforce the agreement to arbitrate or for the entry of judgment on and enforcement of an arbitration award may be brought in any federal or state courts located in Arizona.  The Tribe expressly waives any application of the exhaustion of tribal remedies doctrine that might otherwise require, as a matter of law or comity, that a dispute be heard first in a tribal court.  No action with respect to any disputes, controversies or claims between You, Rockefeller Financial and/or NFS arising in any way from Your accounts, orders, transactions, or the construction, performance or breach of this Addendum or any Agreement between or among the Parties may be brought in tribal court without the prior written consent of Rockefeller Financial and NFS.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum5.">5.</span> <span class="level-heading">Tribal Sovereign Immunity; Consent to Jurisdiction.</span> As authorized by resolution of the Tribal Council, dated _______ <em>and attached hereto</em>, the Tribe  waives its sovereign immunity (and any defense based thereon) with respect to any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Addendum or the underlying brokerage account <u>and</u> agrees to arbitrate any such dispute or controversy in accordance with Section 11 of this Addendum.  The Tribe submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state courts located in Arizona that may have jurisdiction with respect to  any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Addendum or the underlying brokerage account, or for recognition or enforcement of any arbitration award and/or judgment rendered in such action or proceeding pursuant to Section 11 of this Addendum, and each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Arizona federal or state courts.  Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum6.">6.</span> <strong>Waivers Irrevocable</strong></p>
                <p>You expressly and unconditionally agree that the waivers in Sections 4 and 5 above are irrevocable and survive the termination of this Addendum and any related Agreements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum7.">7.</span> <span class="level-heading">Venue.</span> The Tribe, Rockefeller Financial, and NFS each consents to the jurisdiction and venue of any court referred to in Section 5 and waives any argument that venue in such forums is not convenient.  In the event any Party commences any action in another jurisdiction or venue under any tort or contract theory arising directly or indirectly from the relationship created by this Addendum, any Party against which the action is brought, at its option shall be entitled to have the case transferred to one of the jurisdictions and venues above described, or if such transfer cannot be accomplished under applicable law, to have such case dismissed without prejudice.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum8.">8.</span> <span class="level-heading">Minor Trust Instructions.</span> To the extent that the Tribe is investing funds that are part of a tribal trust fund for minor members of a Tribe or subject to the requirement of a tribal trust fund, the Tribe hereby promises, agrees and certifies that the investment instructions provided by the Tribe to Rockefeller Financial will comply with all legal requirements applicable to such funds.  Additionally, the Tribe shall furnish a copy of the Tribe's federally approved Revenue Allocation Plan, as discussed at 25 U.S.C. Â§ 2710(b)(3), where said minor trust is funded with Indian gaming revenue.</p>

Under this clause, which is binding on all Parties, You, Rockefeller Financial, and NFS agree as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum11.A.">A.</span> All parties to this Addendum are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum11.B.">B.</span> Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum11.C.">C.</span> The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements, and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum11.D.">D.</span> The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum11.E.">E.</span> The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="attachments/addendum11.G.">G.</span> The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments thereto, shall be incorporated into this Addendum.</p>
                <p>All controversies that may arise among You, Rockefeller Financial and NFS concerning any subject matter, issue or circumstance whatsoever (including, but not limited to, controversies concerning any account, order, distribution, rollover, advice interaction or transaction, or the continuation, performance, interpretation or breach of this or any other Agreement between You, Rockefeller Financial, and NFS whether entered into or arising before, on or after the date Your account is opened) shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the rules then prevailing of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or any United States securities self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange of which the person, entity or entities against whom the claim is made is a member, as You may designate. If You designate the rules of a United States self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange and those rules fail to be applied for any reason, then You shall designate the prevailing rules of any other United States securities self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange of which the person, entity or entities against whom the claim is made is a member. If You do not notify Rockefeller Financial and NFS in writing of Your designation within five (5) days after such failure or after Rockefeller Financial or NFS receives from you a written demand for arbitration, then You authorize Rockefeller Financial and/or NFS to make such designation on Your behalf. The designation of the rules of a United States self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange is not integral to the underlying agreement to arbitrate. You agree that judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, nor seek to enforce any predispute arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action  until: (i) the class certification is denied; or (ii) the class is decertified; or (iii) You are excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this Addendum except to the extent stated herein.</p>
