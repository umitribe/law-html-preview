All parties to this Addendum are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed. B. Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited. C. The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements, and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings. D. The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date. E. The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry. F. The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court. G. The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments thereto, shall be incorporated into this Addendum. All controversies that may arise among You, Rockefeller Financial and NFS concerning any subject matter, issue or circumstance whatsoever (including, but not limited to, controversies concerning any account, order, distribution, rollover, advice interaction or transaction, or the continuation, performance, interpretation or breach of this or any other Agreement between You, Rockefeller Financial, and NFS whether entered into or arising before, on or after the date Your account is opened) shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the rules then prevailing of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or any United States securities self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange of which the person, entity or entities against whom the claim is made is a member, as You may designate. If You designate the rules of a United States self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange and those rules fail to be applied for any reason, then You shall designate the prevailing rules of any other United States securities self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange of which the person, entity or entities against whom the claim is made is a member. If You do not notify Rockefeller Financial and NFS in writing of Your designation within five (5) days after such failure or after Rockefeller Financial or NFS receives from you a written demand for arbitration, then You authorize Rockefeller Financial and/or NFS to make such designation on Your behalf. The designation of the rules of a United States self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange is not integral to the underlying agreement to arbitrate. You agree that judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, nor seek to enforce any predispute arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action until: (i) the class certification is denied; or (ii) the class is decertified; or (iii) You are excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this Addendum except to the extent stated herein. 12. Governing Law. This Addendum and the Agreements referenced below and the enforcement of this Addendum and Agreements referenced below are governed by the laws of the State of New York, except with respect to its conflicts-of-law provisions. 13.
