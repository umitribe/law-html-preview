E. The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry. F.

If You do not notify Rockefeller Financial and NFS in writing of Your designation within five (5) days after such failure or after Rockefeller Financial or NFS receives from you a written demand for arbitration, then You authorize Rockefeller Financial and/or NFS to make such designation on Your behalf. The designation of the rules of a United States self-regulatory organization or United States securities exchange is not integral to the underlying agreement to arbitrate. You agree that judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, nor seek to enforce any predispute arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action until: (i) the class certification is denied; or (ii) the class is decertified; or (iii) You are excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this Addendum except to the extent stated herein. 12. Governing Law.
